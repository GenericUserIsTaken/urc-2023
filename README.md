# nasa-rmc
An overhaul of [Trickfire Robotics'](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trickfire-robotics/) NASA [Robotic Mining Competition](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc.html) rover software, rewritten for [ROS2](https://design.ros2.org/articles/why_ros2.html).

# Installation
We develop using [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Docker containers keep the development environment well-defined and repeatable: no more mysterious missing dependencies. VS Code is a very extensible text editor that lets us provide the same actions and customizations to every team developer.
